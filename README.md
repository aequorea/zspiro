Vintage eyecandy along the lines of a spirograph

This is based on something that was originally written in Fortran 4 on a PDP-10. The graphics display was a Tektronix 4010 which was a storage display. It needed to be erased between patterns. So it turns out that python turtle graphics was a nice way to recreate the experience of 1970s eyecandy running on a mainframe.

You may need to install python-tk or python3-tk to get it to run (on linux). These may be available from your package manager or your software manager.
