# zspiro
Vintage eyecandy along the lines of a spirograph -- but different.

It starts out looking like a spirograph, but after a while it takes on a character all it's own. Some very cool geometry if you ask me.

This is based on something that was originally written in Fortran 4 on a PDP-10. The graphics display was a Tektronix 4010 which was a storage display. It needed to be erased between patterns. So it turns out that python turtle graphics was a nice way to recreate the experience of 1970s eyecandy running on a mainframe.

You may need to install python-tk or python3-tk to get it to run (on linux). These may be available from your package manager or your software manager.
